The students of MBA were taken to Amritsar at Hanni Industries. The industry dealt in various export quality products. They manufacture many Indian spices, Jaggery and its related products. They also deal in Kesar exports. The countries in which they export their products are Canada, New Zealand, England and many others. Their 95% business is based on exports. The owner of the industry said that he got inspired from his mother’s illness and started manufacturing pure products. He worked as one-man army at the earliest stages of business and then over the years has transformed it into a full-fledged industry. The students have learned a lot in this visit and have given positive feedback and appreciated our prestigious institute for arranging such visits. </p>
